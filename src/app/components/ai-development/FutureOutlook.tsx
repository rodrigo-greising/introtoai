        <p className="text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-300 mb-6">
          AI coding assistants represent a significant shift in how software is developed. While they don&apos;t replace 
          the need for understanding programming fundamentals, they can dramatically reduce the time spent on 
          boilerplate code and repetitive tasks, allowing developers to focus on creative problem-solving and 
          architectural decisions.

        <p className="text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-300">
          As these tools continue to evolve, they&apos;re becoming more sophisticated at understanding context, 
          following coding standards, and generating production-ready code. The key is learning to work 
          effectively with AI as a collaborative partner rather than viewing it as a replacement for human expertise.
